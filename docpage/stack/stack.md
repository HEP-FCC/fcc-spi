FCC Software Stack
================================================


<p><img width="80%" src="https://vavolkl.web.cern.ch/vavolkl/img/fccsw_deps_zoom.png" alt="A simplified diagram showing the interdependencies of HEP/FCC software packages" /></p>

FCC software is an ecosystem of many packages and communities. 
Below is an (almost) exhaustive list
of HEP-specific software packages used in FCC software.
To ensure that all packages are compatible and to reduce the time spent compiling and building we use LCG
releases (<http://lcginfo.cern.ch/>) whenever possible, and integrate as much as possible in the
framework FCCSW.
Many FCC specific packages are tested, built and distributed by the FCC software group. Detailed
informations on version numbers are available in machine-readable format here:
