<h3>About FCCSW</h3>
<p>
  FCCSW is the software for the <a href="http://fcc.web.cern.ch">FCC</a> experiments. We aim to support all detector concepts for all accelerator options (electron-electron, electron-hadron and hadron-hadron). Therefore, we try to create software that is independent of detector or experiment specifics.
</p>
<h3>Conceptual Design Report</h3>
The <a href="http://fcc-cdr.web.cern.ch/">summary volumes</a> have been released, with many
physics and detector simulations prodced in FCCSW. We collaborate with CERN's <a
href="http://www.reanahub.io/">Re-usable Analysis</a> working group to make the workflows used in
the CDR reproducible and accessible for future studies. <a href="https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-fcchh-fullsim" >Here</a> is a first example of a full-simulation
workflow.

<h3>Documentation, Tutorials and Getting Started:</h3>
<p>
Basically all development happens on <a href="https://github.com/HEP-FCC">github.com/HEP-FCC</a>. The best place to check
for detailed information on a specific package is usually its github repository page. To get an
  overview, there are some tutorials that may be helpful. Finally there is a <a
  href="http://cern.ch/simba3/SelfSubscription.aspx?groupName=fcc-experiments-sw-dev">mailing list
  </a> for any questions
  and suggestions.
