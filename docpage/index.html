<h3>About</h3>
<p>
FCCSW is a set of software packages and standards to help different FCC studies work together.
Common software helps to avoid duplicated effort and compare results. In addition, the software
group provides infrastructure and services such as build systems, testing and continuous
integration, code format guidelines, linting and static analysis, release management and software
distribution and data persistency. This is possible due to the kind support of the EP-SFT group.

<h3>Conceptual Design Report</h3>
The <a href="http://fcc-cdr.web.cern.ch/">summary volumes</a> have been released, with many
physics and detector simulations prodced in FCCSW. We collaborate with CERN's <a
href="http://www.reanahub.io/">Re-usable Analysis</a> working group to make the workflows used in
the CDR reproducible and accessible for future studies. <a href="https://github.com/reanahub/reana-demo-fcchh-fullsim" >Here</a> is a first example of a full-simulation
workflow.

<h3>Documentation, Tutorials and Getting Started:</h3>
<p>
Basically all development happens on <a href="https://github.com/HEP-FCC">github.com/HEP-FCC</a>. The best place to check
for detailed information on a specific package is usually its github repository page. To get an
  overview, there are some tutorials that may be helpful. Finally there is a <a
  href="http://cern.ch/simba3/SelfSubscription.aspx?groupName=fcc-experiments-sw-dev">mailing list
  </a> for any questions
  and suggestions.
